# CoronaBot
A quick machine learning bot which uses 4 different articules as a source of the answer. This chatbot is learning that long as you talk with it. It was a school project which was about "Create a chatbot “diagnosing” coronavirus based on the symptoms recorded by the users. You can either use Python / Jupiter or simple framework like Chatfuel."
It has been based on "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems" 1st Edition by Aurélien Géron.
It uses NLTK and Newspaper3k.
